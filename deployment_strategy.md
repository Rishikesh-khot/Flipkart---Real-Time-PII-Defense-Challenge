# Deployment Plan for PII Detection

The script is meant to sit in the data pipeline wherever user data is logged or passed to external systems. Two practical options:

### 1. API Middleware
- Wrap it inside a Python service (FastAPI/Flask).
- Hook it into the request/response cycle.
- Every payload goes through the checker before reaching logs or DB.
- Low overhead since it's regex and simple string checks.

### 2. Log Sanitizer Job
- For existing log files, run this as a batch job (cron or Airflow DAG).
- It will scan logs, redact PII, and write clean versions to storage.

### Scale
- Dockerize it.
- Deploy on Kubernetes as a sidecar container or as a service.
- Horizontal scaling possible, it's stateless.

### Cost/Perf
- Regex based, so CPU-light.
- No external DB calls.
- Fits easily into existing infra without much tuning.

This way PII gets filtered before it leaks to logs or external tools.
